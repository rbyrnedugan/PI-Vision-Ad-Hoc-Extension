This extension adds functionality for creating ad-hoc trends from multiple data items when viewing imported PI ProcessBook® displays in PI Vision™.  

When viewing an imported PI ProcessBook® display, it is now possible to multi-select data items (using Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click) and then create an ad-hoc trend from those data items using the button in the top bar.

This extension is targeted at PI Vision™ 2017 R2 (3.3.x) and earlier. PI Vision™ 2019 will have similar funcionality built in.

This extension is still in beta.

This extension is not supported by OSIsoft.
